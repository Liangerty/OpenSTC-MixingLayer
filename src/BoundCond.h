 * @brief Boundary conditions
 * @details This file contains the definition of boundary conditions. We currently support the following boundary conditions:
 * - 5 Inflow (Inflow) This is the supersonic inflow boundary condition.
 * - 2 Wall (Wall) This is the wall boundary condition.
 * - 6 Outflow (Outflow) This is the supersonic outflow boundary condition.
 * - 3 Symmetry (Symmetry) This is the symmetry boundary condition.
 * - 4 Farfield (FarField) This is the farfield boundary condition with Riemann invariant.
 * - 7 Subsonic inflow (SubsonicInflow) This is the subsonic inflow boundary condition.
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2023-09-08
 * @note Initial version of the file with basic boundary conditions.
